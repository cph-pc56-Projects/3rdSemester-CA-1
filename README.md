Content of our Ca:

Our ca contains several web services that interact directly with our database through the browser. Above there is a file available called "Overview of endpoints" [Here](https://github.com/cph-pc56-Projects/3rdSemester-CA-1/blob/master/overview%20of%20endpoints.xlsx)
you can see a list of endpoints you can access easily through our REST API, the methods that are used and the result you get.

Who did what:

Petru & Felisiah did most of the backend,
Patrick & Marco did most the frontend.

Overall the work was evenly divided.

Future sprints:

Completing rest of the front-end JavaScript page for city

Completing rest of the front-end JavaScript page for company

Further populate the DB with more test data

Testing with Rest Assured

Average time spent a day (Monday-Sunday):
Petru Catana: 6,7 H

Felisiah Yolanda: 6,7 H

Patrick Fenger: 6,4 H

Marco Frydshou: 6,4 H


Feedback:

Computer science is a rapidly changing discipline and we find it inspiring and very positive that the school
goes to the extent of implementing these state of art technologies - They are very relevant to the current market and will help us to 
secure our future as software developing jobseekers.

The students that are here now have persevered through 1st & 2nd semester and are here because we want it and want to work for it. It is our priority and we put the hours necessary into it.
Having said that, the overall experience of these first 3 weeks of the 3rd semester have been very overwhelming and the best word to sum it up is: “rushed”.

The atmosphere of the constant time pressure, along with the never-ending exercises has been resulting in a daily reminder of how inadequate you feel and it is something a very large percentage of both the Dat and Cos course can nod acknowledging to.
One of the warning signs occurred when the teachers at one point in the end of week 2 stated the importance of reading and understanding the learning objectives in the exercises – At which the whole class just look at each other and went: “what learning objectives?” – This reaction is birthed from the fear of not making it through this partly self-created, part school-created illusion of achieving study points to make it through to the “next round”, which drives you to think of one thing, and one thing only: Completing the exercises at whatever cost.
This is a very dangerous stage, because now the students’ mindset is no longer pursuing the ideal learning objectives of the current day, week, month, but rather entering a “survival” mentality mode just to get through the week – Let’s not overdramatize it but you get the point.

Here are a few bullet points to make success achievable for 3rd semester:

•	Review and restore the balance for EPH (Exercises per hour), there is an overkill of exercises.

•	Add very concrete examples and supply answer books for the most common complications occurring.

•	Choose one path and go with it. Lars does it one way, Sigurd’s does it another, Christian does it a third & Thomas does it a fourth.

•	Allocate more resources to tutors, hell even get rid of the breakfast on Fridays if that’s what it takes.


If we in collaboration are to change this perception of the process throughout the rest of this semester and/or for future semesters, these are some of the stuff that (from a student’s perspective) are prior to change.
